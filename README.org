A very simple Common Lisp library for resolving pathnames relative to some directory, usually the sources.

The typical use case looks like this: I am working on, say, some data analysis and I have the following directory structure:

| data/  | where data files are kept                          |
| latex/ | LaTeX sources                                      |
| lisp/  | Common Lisp code, including ASDF system definition |
| plots/ | plots (potentially generated from Lisp)            |

I want to be able to write something like
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (analyze-data-and-save-plot (project-path "mydata.csv" :data)
                              (project-path "myplot.pdf" :plots))
#+END_SRC
and have the data read from =data/mydata.csv= and the plot saved to =plots/myplot.pdf=.

This is how I would do it using this library:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (project-pathname:define project-path (:asdf "myproject" :up)
    (:data "data")
    (:plots "plots"))
#+END_SRC

This finds the directory for the =.asd= file, takes its parent directory, and then defines a function that maps symbols to subdirectories.

Unless otherwise specified, =NIL=, the default for the optional parameter, would map to the base directory.  You don't even need to use subdirectories, you can just
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (project-pathname:define project-path2 (:asdf "myproject"))
  ;;; and then use
  (project-path2 "my-data-file.csv")
#+END_SRC

See the docstrings for alternatives to =:asdf= if you have some other way of establishing the base directory (look for =:directory=, =:as-directory= and =:directory-of=).
